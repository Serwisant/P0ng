# P0ng

This is a simple clone of the Pong game created using [the SFML libraries](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php). My aim was to create a fully functional, standalone game in as small as possible executable file. Currently it is only for two players.

## Editing the project

As the project has been created in Visual Studio, the simplest way to open the project is to do it in Visual Studio using the sln file. However, you will need to configure the SFML in your Visual Studio. [Here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php) you can learn, how to configure the environment.

## Rules

Bounce the "ball" using a pallet, if you miss the ball, another player gets a point. Get 10 points to win!

## Controls

The space key starts the game, the left pallet moves with the A and Z keys, the right pallet moves with the " and / keys. Escape closes the game. You can also use a gamepad with 2 analog sticks to control the pallets (yes, share one controller to play!).

## Tests

As the project has been created in Visual Studio, the build in Test Platform has been used to test the project. When the project is open in Visual Studio, simply run all tests in the Test Explorer. These test also require configured SFML.
